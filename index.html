The goal is to create a back-end application that works as predictive maintenance in applications where temperature measurement is required such as freezers and refrigerators. This application will communicate with APIs by receiving  temperature data from any other compatible platform and will then process (when needed) text-based comments related to a possible pattern anomaly (It is specifically designed for refrigeration, considering loading, defrosting, etc.) The application can send then directly as an API or as WhatsApp & WeChat messages running proactive hours before a serious damage to the cooling system occurs. The application is indented to be used as a addon to existing platforms or PLC applications, so it will not provide a frontend, just a backend, machine learning engine and API
